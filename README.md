# Donor Formatter

This app is designed to format .CSVs and .TXTs downloaded from state campaign finance sites. For it to work properly, it needs to receive **unaltered** files downloaded directly from the campaign sites. It is also still in *early* development, so errors will likely crop up. Please DM me on Slack or email me at jackson.rudoff@applecart.co with any comments, concerns, or error reports!

## Using the Site

Using this tool is fairly straightforward.

1\. Click ```Browse``` and select unaltered donor file downloaded from a state campaign site. It should be structured as a list of **contributions**. 

2\. After the file has uploaded, select the correct state from the dropdown menu. You will know it has worked if a table outputs to the right of the upload panel. If it does not do this, then there is an issue with the file's formatting. *Please feel free to message me if this happens.* 

If it has worked correctly, your screen should look like this:

3\. Click the ```Download``` button, and choose a name for the file. Name it such that you will know it is the correctly formatted file.

4\. Done!
