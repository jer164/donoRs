## Manual Upload vs Linked Donors

-   Generally, we want to work with the data baked into ABBA that we know will match

    ::: incremental
    -   So, in most cases, using the Linked Donors portal is the preferred option
    -   The data is refreshed more frequently
    -   We *usually* know ABBA will like it
    -   It saves time

## Linked Donors

## Upload

-   Manual uploads need to happen for a few reasons

    -   Not enough Linked Donors/no data for that state

    -   Specific people need to be added

    -   You want to include people from someone else's campaign for some reason

-   It used be basically a last resort; now has been required for a lot more projects

    -   CVS \[Insert state here\]

-   It's not *the* preferred method because the data quality is horrendous

## Enter the Formatter

-   The Donor Cleaner exists for two main reasons

    -   Expedite the process (main function)

    -   Ensure compatibility (this has been harder...)

-   In the past, every change was done manually

    -   Renaming and deleting columns

    -   Cleaning the actual data

-   There were lots of problems with this approach

## What the Tool Actually Does

## What the Tool Actually Does

## What Files Do You Use?

-   The tool is programmed for the columns of most state files

    -   So long as you have the right state source, it will work

-   However, it is not that sophisticated beyond the transformations

    -   Doesn't automatically detect some errors

    -   Cannot tell if you have the right file for the right person

    -   If you have the wrong file, it will just give up

## What Files Do You Use?

-   Generally, the file you look for should meet the following criteria:

    -   Comes from a government website (usually the SOS office)

    -   Each row represents an individual donation

    -   The file was generated from a search for **contributions to** or **receipts by**

    -   The file has itemized names and addresses (zips!!) for each donation

## Let's Try It Out!

## Changing File Extensions

-   There are some sites that export a different format from what they claim

-   The website will say "Export CSV" or "Export Excel" and then give you absolute junk

## Kansas... *Michigan*...

## Always Check for the Records Processed!

## What's Wrong With This File?

## Common File Issues

-   *A file has very few listed contributions to a very popular candidate*

    -   Check it's contributions **to** that candidate and not **by** that candidate

-   *The formatted file uploaded to ABBA but no records processed*

    -   Look at the file to see where data is missing

-   *I used a campaign finance site but the tool doesn't like the file*

    -   Some states have 2-3 portals with different file schemas, so see if there is another one

    -   Panic
